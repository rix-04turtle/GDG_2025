# 🥗 MealBridge – Bridging Surplus to Need

MealBridge is a **community-driven web application** designed to tackle the twin challenges of food waste and hunger by enabling seamless peer-to-peer food donations. Built with **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **Google Maps**, the platform empowers individuals, local restaurants, canteens, and households to donate surplus or excess food to those in need — from underprivileged families to NGOs and community kitchens.

By streamlining the process of posting, discovering, and claiming food donations, MealBridge not only reduces food going to waste but also fosters a culture of empathy, sustainability, and shared responsibility within neighborhoods.
